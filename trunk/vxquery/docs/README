Apache VXQuery
--------------


Requirements:

1. JDK >= 1.6
2. Apache Maven >= 2.0


Setup:

VXQuery is currently only located in SVN. The following instructions are to check out the 
active version under active development. In addition to VXQuery, the current release of 
Hyracks needs to be set up for VXQuery to run properly. The following steps are to be followed
from the command line.

1. Create a folder for all the VXQuery files. 

$ mkdir /path/to/VXQuery
$ cd /path/to/VXQuery

2. Download and install the Hyracks Asterix Stabilization branch.

$ svn checkout https://hyracks.googlecode.com/svn/branches/hyracks_asterix_stabilization hyracks_asterix_stabilization
(Accept the certificate information for *.googlecode.com.)
$ cd hyracks_asterix_stabilization
$ mvn install -DskipTests
$ cd ..

3. Download and install the Apache VXQuery Incubating.

$ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/vxquery/trunk/ apache_vxquery_incubating
(Accept the certificate information for *.apache.org.)
$ cd apache_vxquery_incubating/vxquery
$ mvn package -DskipTests
$ cd ../..


Running:

There are two ways to run VXQuery:
Note: shell scripts exist for running VXQuery for Un*x like systems.
TODO: Add Windows batch files

1. Command line client (vxq)

Type "sh apache_vxquery_incubating/vxquery/vxquery-cli/target/appassembler/bin/vxq" without any 
arguments for help on executing the command line client.


2. XQTS test driver (xtest)

The xtest test driver can be used to execute XQuery tests from the XQTS suite.

Type "sh apache_vxquery_incubating/vxquery/vxquery-xtest/target/appassembler/bin/xtest" without 
any arguments for help on executing xtest.

Typically the test suite will need extra memory to run and output can be stored in html for easy viewing.
Sample Test Command: JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m" sh apache_vxquery_incubating/vxquery/vxquery-xtest/target/appassembler/bin/xtest -xqtsbase apache_vxquery_incubating/testsuites/XQTS/ -htmlreport /tmp/full_report.html
The result can be viewed at file:///tmp/full_report.html

Note: XQTS test suite is set up as part of the Apache VXQuery Incubating setup process.
