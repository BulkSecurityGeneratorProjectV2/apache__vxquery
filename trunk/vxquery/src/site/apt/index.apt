Apache VXQuery

  Apache VXQuery (Versatile XQuery) will be a standards compliant XML Query processor implemented in Java. 
  The focus is on the evaluation of queries on large amounts of XML data.
  Specifially the goal is to evaluate queries on large collections of relatively small XML documents.
  To achieve this queries will be evaluated on a cluster of shared nothing machines.

  There are lots of large colletions of relatively small documents like e.g. the EDGAR dataset [1] or the OpenStreetMap dataset.
  However there are no XQuery processors available today that are capable of handling these datasets and making this contained information accessible.

* Incubation Disclaimer

  Apache VXQuery is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software 
  Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache XMLBeans PMC. 
  Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review 
  indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making 
  process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF 
  projects. 
  While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness 
  or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be 
  fully endorsed by the ASF.
