NOAA GHCN-Daily Benchmark
=====================

# Introduction

The NOAA has hosted DAILY GLOBAL HISTORICAL CLIMATOLOGY NETWORK (GHCN-DAILY) 
.dat files. Weather.gov has an RSS/XML feed that gives current weather sensor 
readings. Using the RSS feed as a template, the GHCN-DAILY historical 
information is used to generate past RSS feed XML documents. The process allows 
testing on a large set of information with out having to continually monitor 
the weather.gov site for all the weather details for years.
